# tool_warnings

warn the player before their tool breaks.

the warning is implemented both as the "tool breaks" sound before the tool breaks, and via a chat message.

by default, this only works for "normal" tools, that is, tools which are worn down by digging nodes via the builtin
game mechanics. see [API.md] if you want to add the warning mechanic to tools with custom use/rightclick/place
behaviors.
